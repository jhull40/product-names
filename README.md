The main solution can be found in the home directory and is called `solution.ipynb`

I have three notebooks within the `models` directory that were used to process the data, run LDA topic models, and run BERTopic.

The `data` directory has the raw data and some cleaned datasets I also used.

The `output` directory has some model output and images generated for my solution.
